        <p1> I am a lecturer in the Stanford Computer science depatment. Before coming to Stanford, I spent two years as a programmer at Taligent (now part of IBM). At Taligent, I worked on Places for Project Teams, a groupware product designed to improve communication and coordination within small project teams. I was fortunate to work with the Places for Project Teams product throughout an entire software lifecycle--from initial product conception through the actual product launch.</p1>
