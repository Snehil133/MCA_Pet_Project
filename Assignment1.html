        <h1>The dog is a pet animal.</h1><br>
           He is a very clever animal and is very useful in catching thieves. 
           He runs very fast, barks loudly and attacks the strangers.</h1>
        <p>My pet dog is the most loyal friend I could have asked for. 
           He is a Husky named Tommy and he has been a part of our family for 3 years now. 
           Tommy has a friendly nature and loves to play with us.
           He is very active and loves to go for long walks with us.</p>
        <p>Caring for an animal can help children grow up more secure and active.</p>>
